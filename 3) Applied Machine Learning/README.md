# Applied Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This folder contains **real-world ML projects** using datasets to build, train, and evaluate models.

## 📂 Project Structure
Each project follows this workflow:
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning** - Processing raw data.
2. **EDA & Feature Engineering** - Understanding and transforming data.
3. **Model Selection & Training** - Comparing different ML models.
4. **Evaluation & Optimization** - Improving model performance.
5. **Deployment (Optional)** - Serving models with APIs or web apps.

## 🚀 Projects
- 🤖Project_1/ - Ecommerce Customers - Analyzed the performance of a company's mobile app vs website and recommended focusing more on the mobile app due to its better performance.

- 🤖 Project_2/ - Calories Prediction - Implemented a linear regression model to predict calorie consumption based on the given dataset (calories.csv).

- 🤖Project_3/ - Iris Flower Classification - Built a classification model using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to predict flower species in the Iris dataset, achieving an accuracy of 87%.



## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python (Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
